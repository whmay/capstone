Image recognition is one sub-area of computer vision. It deals with how computer detects and recognizes objects in the image. My graduate project focus on Chinese landmarks & attractions, which is a useful yet challenging task due to the lack of such a dataset. My project includes the following,
•	Develop Chinese landmarks & attractions dataset.
•	Review commercial landmark recognition APIs.
•	Develop a prototype of iOS landmark & attractions recognition application.

Folder spiderpy, web scraping landmark list and images from Ctrip, TripAdvisor, and Google search.
Folder reveiwAPI, review MS and Google landmark recognition model.
landmark.ipynb, is a Goolge colab file, fine-tune a ResNet in Keras, with Chinese landmarks & attractions dataset.
Folder landmarkClassifier, use the model build from landmark.ipynb to develop an iOS application.
